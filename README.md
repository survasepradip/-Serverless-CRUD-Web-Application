# ServerlessWebApp
Serverless Web Application on AWS
Project Name: Serverless Web Application on AWS
Project Description:
In this project, you will build a serverless web application using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3. The application will allow users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) items from a DynamoDB table.

Steps to Build the Project:
Create a DynamoDB table to store the items. \
Build a Lambda function to handle the CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table. \
Use S3 to store and host the web application's static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). \
Create a CloudFront distribution to serve the S3-hosted static files with low latency. \
